# Safety

### Safety Concepts

- Autonomous driving crashes
    - Hard to predict other driver's reaction
    - Decision making in self-driving cars (more aggresive driving style etc.)
    - No real time checks on safety driver
    - Misclassification (resulted in ignoring pedestrian) Perception failure
    - Emergency backup not available (braking system)

- Formal definitions
    - Harm: Physical harm to a living thing
    - Risk: Probability event occurs
    - Safety: Absence of unreasonable harm
    - Hazard: Potential source of unreasonable risk of harm

### Hazard sources
- Mechanical: Incorrect assembly
- Electrical: Faulty wiring
- Hardware: Computing hardware chips used for AV
- Software: Bugs
- Sensors: Inaccurate perception
- Behavioural: Incorrect
- Fallback: Lack of warning to driver
- Cyber: Hacked by malicious entity

### Industry perspectives on safety

### Safety frameworks for self-driving
- Systems engineering approach to safety (NHTSA Framework)
    - Autonomy design
        - Well defined ODD
        - Well tested OEDR: Critical to perception and crash avoidance 
        - Fallback: How to bring system to minimal risk condition if anything happens
        - Traffic laws of country observed
        - Cybersecurity
        - Status info displayed Human Machine Interface (HMI)
    - Testing and Crash Mitigation
        - Testing: Simulation, close track testing, public road driving
        - Crashworthiness
        - Post-Crash: Support, returned to safe state, first responders alerted
        - Data recording (Black Box) : To know what went wrong in the event of a failure
        - Consumer Education: Ensuring natural overconfidence does not result in unneceessary crashes
